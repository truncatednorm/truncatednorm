<p>For my job I recently was tasked with creating a hybrid modeling technique that adopted aspects of both gravitational (i.e., spatial interaction modeling) and machine learning approaches. I quickly got to work and created a few model prototypes using the optimization functions within <code>R</code>. However, I found that for the size of the datasets I was using and the complexity of the objective function, convergence was time consuming. Of course my first instinct was to write a cleaner objective function in hopes that it would speed up the mimiziation, but after a few hours, I realized that I was not going to approach the level of speed that I desired. And thisâ€¦ is when <code>Rcpp</code> entered my life. Learning <code>Rcpp</code> had been a desire of mine for several years, but I never had the use case to invest the time to learn it. Of course there are several great resources for creating simple <code>Rcpp</code> files (e.g., Advanced R) and then there are also many complex examples available within current <code>R</code> packages. It is the middle area that seemed not to have much resources attributed to it. In order to help fill this void, I will be providing several tutorials on building functions in <code>Rcpp</code>.</p>

<h2>A Likelihood Function for Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>As a starting place for creating optimization functions, I often turn to programing logistic regression from scratch. It is a fairly simple model if you utilize the distributional functions available within <code>R</code> or <code>Rcpp</code>, but the function provides enough complexity that it allows you to learn the proper syntax. We will start out with simulating an example dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
n&lt;-1000 #number of observations
p&lt;-10 #number of parameters
X&lt;-cbind(1,replicate(p-1,runif(n,-1,1))) #design matrix
beta&lt;-runif(p,-3,3) #regression coefficients
y&lt;-rbinom(n,1,plogis(X%*%beta)) #simulate target
simdat&lt;-data.frame(target=y,X[,-1]) # form data.frame
names(simdat)[-1]&lt;-paste0(&quot;x&quot;,seq(ncol(X)-1)) #name variables</code></pre>
<p>Of course we could fit a logist regression model using <code>glm</code>, but in order to learn the concepts of optimization using <code>Rcpp</code>, we are going to write out several different routines to fit this model from scratch. First we will write out an objective function in R and then minimize it using <code>optim</code>. Then we will move on to writting the same function in <code>Rcpp</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>likr&lt;-function(parms){
  return(parms)
}</code></pre>
